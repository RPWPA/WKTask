# Important notice

I haven't used Angular in quite a while so most of this project and its structuring was done using AI and going back and forth with it. It also took like 7-8 hours so there is that as well.

# How to run

To run this project, clone the repo. Go into the folder and run "npm i". When that is done, run 'ng serve' and this should be enough for you to test it.
